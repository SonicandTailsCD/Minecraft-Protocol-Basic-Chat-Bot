Credit

I have to give most of the credit to [SonicandTailsCD](https://github.com/SonicandTailsCD). this was ment to jusy be a single time thing where i upload thos for people on [Kaboom](kaboom.pw) to use but SonicandTailsCD has done his best to make this project easy and ready to use. Big thanks to him. I might not update this too often so the most up to date version would most likely be on here: https://github.com/SonicandTailsCD/Minecraft-Protocol-Basic-Chat-Bot

This is meant to be a very basic minecraft chat bot verification system with hardcoded commands for beginners. Go ahead and do what you want with it.

How To Run
1. Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download this repository (or clone with `git clone https://github.com/spyingcreeper09/Minecraft-Protocol-Basic-Chat-Bot.git`)
3. Extract the files to your directory of choice
4. Open a Command Prompt ("Terminal" on MacOS/Linux)
5. Navigate to the current directory (if you haven't already)
6. Run 'npm ci' (if there's a `package-lock.json` file, otherwise, use `npm install`)
7. Once that has finished, run `node index.js [host] (optional: server port, bot name, password. Don't type in the server port if you don't know it - most likely it's the default (25565).)` in the terminal to start the script

Note
I recomend downloading some sort of code editor program. I use Visual Studio Code (or "VS Code" for short) - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

If you change the name of the main file, in this case `index.js`, then you need to adjust the command to be `node [updated file name].js` to start it. If you have any spaces in the file name, use double quotes to allow it to run. :)
